### FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Expected output:
```

### No Repeats
Return the number of total permutations of the provided string that don't have repeated consecutive letters. Assume that all characters in the provided string are each unique.

For example, aab should return 2 because it has 6 total permutations (aab, aab, aba, aba, baa, baa), but only 2 of them (aba and aba) don't have the same letter (in this case a) repeating.

### Inventory Update 
Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery. Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1). If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array.The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item.

### Validate Subsequence
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers `[1, 3, 4]` form a subsequence of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and so do the numbers `[2, 4]`. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

Sample Input:
```
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
```

Sample Output:
```
true
```
